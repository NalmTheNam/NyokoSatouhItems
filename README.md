### If you want to collab here, follow these steps:
1. If you have an discord account, DM me. (my account is NamIsAWinner#6429)
> If nam does not respond in an long time, you may want to DM Hunter, one of nam's partners at yooperhunter2#5826. (note that this is not an business and are not affiliated with repl.it in any way)
but hunter might be able to contact nam and (possibly) assist you, he maybe offline. If he is you may need to wait. (this may take up to around 5 days)

2. You send a request to NyokoSatouhSato in repl.it.
> Hunter may fail if nam does not respond to this as he can't invite other people.
3. If NyokoSatouhSato denies/accepts your request, you cannot make another one until NyokoSatouhSato invites you to collaborate or send an invite to you.
